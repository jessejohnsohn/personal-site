=====================

This is the personal website of Jesse Johnson.
====================

I've built simple websites in the past, so I'm very familiar with HTML and CSS,
and I have some familiarity with Javascript.

I've been focusing most my learning lately on the Rails framework, and you'll
see that this simple Bootstrap site is actually built on top of Rails. And for really
no reason at all other than to show that I can and for myself to play around with.

It will be constantly changing and evolving as I learn more and wish to experiment.

Thanks for checking it out!

Jesse
